Popular Movies Stage 1 - Final Version

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. The Movies app allows users to discover the most popular movies playing. The core experience of your movies app includes:

Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
Allow user to change sort order via a setting:
The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated.
Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
original title
movie poster image thumbnail
A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
user rating (called vote_average in the api)
release date.

This app demonstrates my understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Android. 

The app will fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
The app uses adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
The app incorporates libraries to simplify the amount of code one needs to write.

To try building and running the app, Plug-In your themoviedb.org web API Key to strings.xml file.
